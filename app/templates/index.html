        <p>
          Hi! My name is Toby and I'm an aspiring web developer based in Bristol. An aerospace engineer by training,
           I am now looking for a new challenge in web development.
       
        <br>
        <br>
      
          I have worked on several complex technical projects in the aerospace sector which I believe has given me a pragmatic approach to problem solving. 
          I also believe I am a fast learner with a proven track record of taking on new challenges with enthusiasm.
       
        <br>
        <br>

            <p class="project__description">I have completed several long bicycle tours over the years and I like to
                plot the routes I have followed on a map so I can share my progress day by day with friends and family.
                Previously, this meant downloading individual GPS track files, manually stitching them together and then
                uploading the resulting file to a service such as Google Maps.
                <br><br>
                I created Tour Tracker to automate and simplify this process by leveraging the user data available
                through the public API provided by the popular fitness tracking service Strava. Once the user has
                granted access to their Strava data, Tour Tracker will retrieve the relevant activity data through the
                Strava API before creating a visualisation of the route using the Google Maps JavaScript API.
                <br><br>
                The visualisation will automatically be updated whenever the user uploads a new activity to Strava
                through the use of a webhook subscription through the Strava Webhook Events API.

            <p class="project__description">I recently completed a year long cycle tour through Latin America from
                Seattle to northern Argentina (albeit with a pandemic induced hiatus in the middle!) To document this
                journey and share my photography I started a blog on the Adobe Portfolio platform. I found Portfolio
                not particularly well suited to my needs and so decided to see if I could build something better myself.
                <br><br>
                My key requirements were that I be able to upload photos and articles easily from the road, retain
                design freedom on how the website front end was constructed and for the website to provide an enjoyable
                user experience across a variety of end user devices. For these reasons I chose to use a headless CMS
                architecture, settling on Strapi, complemented by a front end built using the Angular framework.
                <br><br>
                I leveraged the capabilities of the Angular framework, such as using dependency injection to inject a
                service to resize image files based on viewport size.

            <p class="project__description">I am a big fan of cycle touring and I like to plot the routes I have followed on a map day by day so 
              friends and family back home can follow my progress. Previously, this meant downloading individual GPS track data files 
              before manually joining them and uploading to a Google Maps account.
              <br><br>
              This app allows the user to connect to their account on a number of popular fitness tracking services (Strava, RideWithGPS etc) 
              and specify a date range. The app will then retrieve the GPS track data for all activities in that date range before plotting 
              them on a map which the user can then share or embed in their own website.
