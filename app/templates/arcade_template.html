    I have completed several long bicycle tours over the years and I like to
    plot the routes I have followed on a map so I can share my progress day by day with friends and family.
    Previously, this meant downloading individual GPS track files, manually stitching them together and then
    uploading the resulting file to a service such as Google Maps.
    <br><br>
    I created Tour Tracker to automate and simplify this process by leveraging the user data available
    through the public API provided by the popular fitness tracking service Strava. Once the user has
    granted access to their Strava data, Tour Tracker will retrieve the relevant activity data through the
    Strava API before creating a visualisation of the route using the Google Maps JavaScript API.
    <br><br>
    The visualisation will automatically be updated whenever the user uploads a new activity to Strava
    through the use of a webhook subscription through the Strava Webhook Events API.
